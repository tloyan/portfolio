      <p>Hello  from an eternal pationated learner. Iâ€™am enjoying with nearly everything, I can play with  embarked system then a website  then a design then an algorythm. But even with that there is things always present in my mind... doing things work, doing things right, doing thing fast and optimised. Also I love taking in consideration that things are made for a good reason, for people. I think taking Tech things from business perspective is a essential.Currently I am playing with frontendmentor challenge, also learning algo things and reading about clean architecture and more</p>
      <p>If you want to know me more. I love my familly and I love taking time with my child, discovering life with him a travers this eyes. Like I said I couldnt say that I have one passion because I get passion from everything easily but if you want some, I love learning and trying new thing like cooking, gardening, I love board game and role game like Dungeon dragon, cycling and walk my dog. I also pationated by all these different culture and people in this world.</p>
      <p>Be warned ! I probably begin to be pationated by your project </p>
